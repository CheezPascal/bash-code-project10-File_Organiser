Making a file organizer 

Here's a Bash script to organize a folder's contents by Year and Month based on file modification dates. 
It includes comments for clarity and provides notifications before and after the process.

Organize By Date

How to Use
1. Save the script to a file, e.g., organize_folder.sh.
2. Make it executable: chmod +x organize_folder.sh.

3. Run the script with the folder path as an argument:


./organize_folder.sh /path/to/your/folder

The script will organize files by their modification year and month, creating subdirectories as needed. It also provides a summary of the actions taken.
